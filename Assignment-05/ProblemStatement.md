# Time Series Analysis of Sales Data

## Problem Statement
You are given a dataset containing daily sales data for a retail company spanning the last 2 years. The company wants to understand sales patterns and trends to make better inventory and staffing decisions.

## Objectives
1. Analyze and visualize the time series data to identify patterns
2. Process the data through monthly aggregation to understand broader trends
3. Apply moving averages to smooth out daily fluctuations
4. Decompose the time series to understand underlying patterns

## Requirements
1. Use Python with pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels libraries
2. Load and preprocess the time series data from 'time_series_data.csv'
3. Perform the following analyses:
   - Monthly data aggregation
   - 5-day moving average calculation
   - Time series decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual components)
4. Create visualizations for:
   - Original vs Moving Average comparison
   - Decomposition components
   
## Expected Deliverables
1. Python code implementing the analysis
2. Visualizations of the time series components
3. Brief interpretation of the findings

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of time series techniques
- Quality of visualizations`
- Interpretation of results
- Code readability and documentation

## Notes
- The dataset contains two columns: 'Date' and 'Value'
- Missing values should be handled appropriately
- Consider the business implications of the findings
