# Problem Statement: Weather Data API Integration

## Objective
Create a Python application that demonstrates the ability to:
1. Connect to and retrieve data from the OpenWeatherMap API
2. Process JSON responses and extract relevant weather information
3. Implement automated data collection at regular intervals

## Requirements
1. The application should:
   - Fetch real-time weather data for any given city
   - Handle API responses and potential errors gracefully
   - Parse JSON data to extract temperature, humidity, and weather description
   - Automatically collect data every hour
   - Store or display the collected data in a structured format

2. Technical Requirements:
   - Use the requests library for API calls
   - Implement JSON parsing
   - Use scheduling for automated data collection
   - Handle API authentication using API keys

## Expected Outcome:
•	Retrieves live weather data.
•	Parses JSON response.
•	Automates fetching every hour.
