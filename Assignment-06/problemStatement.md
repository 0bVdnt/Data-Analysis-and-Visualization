# Problem Statement:
    Given a dataset with one or more independent variables and a dependent variable, your task is to fit a linear regression model. Analyze the relationship between the variables by interpreting the coefficients of the model. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualize the results to understand the fit of the regression line.
